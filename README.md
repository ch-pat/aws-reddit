# aws-reddit
This was a university project that collected reddit posts using a script running on an AWS EC2 instance and saved them to a DynamoDB table.
A web-app written in streamlit then allowed to filter posts and show relevant statistics.
The school account used is (or will soon be) deactivated therefore functionality can't be demonstrated anymore but the code is kept for safekeeping and future reference.
